Hello and thanks for trying out my Arcs mod for Tabletop Playground.

When you load the mod, you'll start with all the components for four players including leaders and lore, and all of the campaign content too. You could just start playing the game right away if you wanted.

But, we have several options for automatic setup.

Let's just start with the base game: all you need to do is shuffle the appropriate deck for your player count and draw a card.
Drawing a setup card runs initial setup of choosing a random first player and setting up the court along with removing any unneeded components.
If you're looking to play a specific setup, go ahead and find and draw that instead.
Once you know which setup card you're using, you can right click and choose "Setup".
Or, you can also press R on the card.

If you're new to Tabletop Playground, you should get used to using R to do the primary action of any object: shuffling a deck of cards, rolling dice, or initiating an action.
You'll see me use it often in this mod.

Once you run the setup card, ships, buildings, and resources get setup following the card and a first hand of action cards are dealt.
From here, you can immediately start the first round.

Let's back up and use Leaders and Lore though.

After you've chosen a setup card remember a first player has been randomly chosen and what cards start in the court is available knowledge.
So, you can go into the Leader and Lore draft, including whichever decks you want. Here I'll go ahead and combine everything from the base game and the Leaders and Lore expansion, shuffle everything then draw.
We picked a three player game, so four of each.
On shuffling the Leader deck, the rules will turn to the appropriate page to remind you of how to draft: we go in reverse turn order picking Leader or Lore cards.
Place your draft Leader and Lore cards next to your player board.
Once those are in place, _now_ you can finish running setup by pressing R on the setup card.
Notice how the ship, building, and resource setup has now followed the setup specified on each Leader card.

This mod makes campaign setup a cinch too.
So, let's just cover that really quickly before moving on.
To start a campaign, all you need to do is shuffle the "A" Fate deck and choose how many players you have.
Two "A" Fates will be dealt to each player and the rest of the board will be setup according to the Blighted Reach campaign setup.
Players pick between their "A" Fates and place them simultaneously next to their player boards on top of the starting Imperial Regent cards.
Fate sets will spawn on top of the chosen Fate cards and your objective marker will be placed accordingly.
Continue player setup using each Fate's setup card, making sure the First Regent tile goes to the proper player.
Continue setup from the campaign rule book to place ships and buildings and gain starting resources.
Click Deal on the action deck when you're ready to start the game.

With setup done, let's get into some of the mod features that help you play the game more easily.

Let's cover card play.
I'll go ahead and lead a card, nothing new here.
Now, as second player let's try surpassing.
A button will appear below the highest surpassing action card of the lead suit.
Right now, it just serves as a clear indicator as to which card will take initiative; you don't want to click it yet.
I'll finish out this round and at this point click Discard.
I'll also click the Surpass button and the initiative will move to the player of the card.
You'll notice by default the discard holder is face up, due to, well, my personal preference.
Before the game starts, you can switch it to face down discard by unlocking it, and choosing Toggle to face down in its context menu.

Ok now let's go through another round, but this time the second player is going to seize the initiative.
A Seize button will appear now, which you should click.
The initiative marker will move to the player of the card and be placed flat to indicate it's been seized this round.

Finally, at the end of the chapter go ahead and click End Chapter to reshuffle all of the action cards and click Deal again to start a new one.

That covers all of the action cards, let's move on to ships and buildings.

Ship damage can be toggled by pressing R on any ships.
F can also be used to flip them up and reorient them.
As you're dragging groups of ships around, you can press 1-9 to tidy them up into that may rows.

Building damage similarly can be toggled with R or F.

Ok, now a big but tedious part of Arcs is counting and tallying stuff.
This mod tries to make a bunch of that easier.

Let's start with everyone's favorite dice.
Pick whatever dice you want to roll and put them in the dice tray here.
R to roll.
Feel free to spam the R button to convince yourself of more randomness.
When they land, the dice results are summed in the top left of the screen.
The player aid is here too if you need a quick recap of dice faces and odds.

Influence in the courtâ€¦
As you add agents in the court, tallies will appear near the contended court cards.

Finally, how many times have you been eyeing an opponents trophy stack and needed to ask for a count?
Tallies for all the ambitions colored by player are here at the bottom of each ambition box.

That's it! I hope that helps explain some of the hard to find features of this mod.

And I guess finally, maybe you're wondering: why don't I just insert UI that's more explicit and less subtle?
Well, I guess I'd say that I very much appreciate the current design of this game, as it is, in real life and in person.
I want to replicate as much of the feeling of playing in person as possible in this mod.
So, if you have to cram 20 ships into a contentious system and it's
