A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough Power—\nessentially points. In games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least 27 Power. With 3 players,\n30 Power. With 2 players, 33 Power. When the game ends, the player with the most Power wins.\nYou gain Power by completing ambitions, which are objectives that you declare in play. These are\nscored at the end of the chapter, when everyone runs out of action cards. The game lasts a varying\nnumber of chapters, usually three to five.\nYour first game of Arcs will take about 45 minutes per player. After you play a few times, a game\nshould take about 30 minutes per player.\nIf you want to learn Arcs by watching a video, you’ll find a link on the back cover of this rulebook!\n\nWhat’s in the Box \b\nMap\n\nThe map of the Reach is where the action happens. You can move your ships around it, battle\nRivals for control over its systems, and tax resources from the cities you build on its planets.\n\nPlayer Pieces\nEach player has the following pieces. The box contains pieces for 4 players.\n\n2•\n\nPLAYER BOARD\n\nSTARPORTS (5)\n\nCITIES (5)\n\nThis board holds resources, your\nunbuilt cities, and Rival pieces you\ntake as Trophies and Captives.\n\nStarports are built on planets\nand are used to build ships.\n\nCities are built on planets and\ncan be taxed to gain resource\ntokens onto your player board.\n\nSHIPS (15)\n\nAGENTS (10)\n\nPOWER MARKER (2)\n\nShips can move around the\nmap and engage in battles.\n\nAgents are placed on cards in the\nCourt, a card row next to the map.\nOnce you have the most agents on\na card in the Court, you can take it.\n\nThis marker tracks your current Power\non the bottom map edge. The second\nmarker is used in expansions to track\nnegative Power and very high Power.\n\n\fCards\n01\n\n1\n\n2 Players - Frontiers\n\nfor experienced\nplayers\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nout of\nplay\n\n1a\n\n2c\n\n2b\n\n1b\n\n1c\n2c\n\nElder\n\n2a\n\nBeloved.

They are used in\nLeaders & Lore mode (page 21).\n\n(4 each for 2–4 players)\n\nMass Uprising\nWhen Secured: Choose a cluster on the\nmap. You place 1 ship in each system of\nthat cluster. Discard this card.\n\nLoyal Engineers\n\nTool-Priests\n\nIf you Provoke Outrage, keep this card.\n\nSummon (Build): Once per turn, build\n1 ship at any city you control.\n\nYou may spend any resources as\nMaterial.

They start on\nof the lead card, making it 0,\ntheir blue side with lower numbers.\nwhen an ambition is declared.\n\nCHAPTER MARKER\nThis marker tracks the current\nchapter of the game on the map.\n\nINITIATIVE MARKER\nThis marker shows which player\nwill take the first turn of a round.\nPlaying a Chapter\nIn a chapter, players will play through many rounds until they run out of cards.\nWhen chapter ends, players gain Power from declared ambitions. (See the last page.)\nIn a round, each player takes one turn, starting with the player who has initiative.\nWhen the round ends, discard all played cards and see whether initiative changes players.\n\nFirst, the player with the initiative marker takes a turn.\nIf your hand is empty or you choose not to play a card, pass the initiative clockwise to the\nnext player with cards in their hand. They take the first turn of the round instead of you.\n\nPlay Lead Card\n\n2\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nYou must play an action card as the lead card. You may\ntake one action per pip on the card in its top-left corner.\n(This card has 4 pips, letting you take 4 actions.)\n\nIf you have the initiative, you may declare the ambition hown in the bottom-left\ncorner of your card: Place the zero marker over your card’s number but not its pips,\nand put the highest Available ambition marker in the matching ambition box on the\nmap. (Ambitions are listed on the last page.)\n\nSecond, each other player in clockwise order takes a turn.\n\n4\n\nSurpass\n\nADMINISTRATION\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nPlay an action card matching the lead card’s suit but\nwith a higher number than it.

Set Up Players\nL. Each player chooses a color, collects\nthe matching player board, 5 cities,\n5 starports, 15 ships, and 10 agents,\nand places the cities in the triangle slots\nalong the top of their player board.\nM. Each player puts their Power marker on\nthe “0” Power track space on the map.\nN. Players simultaneously place their starting\npieces onto the map as follows. The player\nwith the initiative marker does this:\n• Place 3 ships and 1 city in the system\nmarked 1A on the setup card. Place the\nleftmost city from your player board.\n• Place 3 ships and 1 starport\nin the system marked 1B.\n• Place 2 ships in the system\n(3–4 players) or 2 systems\n(2 players) marked 1C.\n\nGoing clockwise from the player with\ninitiative, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th players\nset up in the same way in the systems\nmarked 2A–C, 3A–C, and 4A–C\non the setup card, respectively.\nO. Each player gains the 2 resource tokens\nmatching the planet icons in their\nA and B systems, putting them in the\nleftmost and next leftmost circle slots\non their player board, respectively.\nP. Each player draws 6 action cards into\ntheir hand. 2 Players Only: The player\nwithout initiative may discard all 6 action\ncards in their hand and draw 6 new ones.\nQ. Discard all action cards not in\nplayers’ hands into a facedown\naction discard pile on the map.\n•5\n\n\fCore Concepts \b\nThe Arc of Play\nIn a game of Arcs, you play through a number of chapters,\nusually three to five. Each chapter is made up of several\nrounds.\n\nAt the end of the chapter, players gain Power from declared\nambitions that they fulfilled best. It doesn’t matter whether\nanother player declared an ambition—anyone can fulfill it.\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nPlayers gain Power by fulfilling ambitions. The player with\nthe initiative marker may choose to declare the ambition\nshown on the action card they play on their turn, marking the\nmatching ambition box on the right map edge.\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nPower & Ambitions\n\n3\n3\nBuild or Repair\n\nKeep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards\nin their hand. At this point, the chapter ends, players gain\nPower from ambitions they fulfilled, and everyone draws a\nnew hand of cards. You’ll learn more in Ending a Chapter\n(page 18)!\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBroadly, in a round, each player will take one turn by playing\nan action card to do various actions, starting with the player\nwho has initiative. After everyone takes a turn, players check\nwho gets initiative for the next round. You’ll learn more in\nPlaying a Chapter (page 8)!\n\nDeclaring Ambition\n\nThe Map\nThe map is made of 6 clusters. Each cluster has 4 systems:\n3 planets and 1 gate, which lists the cluster number.\n\nGate\n\nA system is adjacent to other systems sharing a thin border.\nAdjacency is most important when moving (page 13).\n\n• Each gate is adjacent to the 3 planets in its cluster\n•\n\nand to the gates of its 2 neighboring clusters.\nEach planet is adjacent to the gate in its cluster, and it\nis adjacent to one or both neighboring planets. Planets\nseparated by a thick, irregular border are not adjacent.\n\nThe center of the map with the Arcs logo is not in play.\nIn setup, 1 or 2 clusters are covered with out-of-play\nmarkers on its planets and a path marker on its gate. These\nclusters are out of play in every way. The path marker joins\ntogether the gates of the two neighboring clusters, allowing\nfor movement between them in a single move.\nEach planet has a planet type, along with 1 or 2 building\nslots where you can build cities and starports. (Each planet\nalso has an ID symbol of , , or , used in expansions.)\n6•\n\nPlanet\nCluster 4\n\nPlanet Types\n\nBuilding Slot\n\n\fResources & Cities\nThere are 5 types of resources matching the 5 planet types.\nUsually, you gain them by taxing cities (page 12) and raiding\nRivals in battle (page 16).\n\nResources\n\nResources can be spent for various actions (page 17), and\nsome of them add to the Tycoon, Keeper, and Empath\nambitions (page 18).\n\nOpening Resource Slots\n\nYou hold resource tokens in the resource slots on your player\nboard. As you build cities, you open resource slots and\nuncover Power bonuses for winning ambitions.\n\nAgents & The Court\nYour agents are the bureaucrats and diplomats that administer\nyour cities and influence powerful interests in the Reach.\nLoyal Marines\n\nShipping Interest\n\nIf you Provoke Outrage, keep this card.\nYou may spend any resources as Weapons.\nYou ignore Outrage when spending\nWeapons for their Prelude action.\nPrelude: You may discard this to place 3 ships\nin a system you control.\n\nSynthesize (Build): Gain 1 Fuel.\n\nBC\n\nBC\n\nGUILD\n\nPrelude: You may discard this to gain\nFuel up to your number of empty\nresource slots. If the Fuel supply\nempties, steal the Fuel instead.\n\n15\n\nGUILD\n\nInfluencing the Court\n\n09\n\nThrough play, you can place agents on cards in the Court, a\nrow of cards along the edge of the map (Influence, page 13).\nIf you have the most agents on a card in the Court, you can\ntake it (Secure, page 13).\n\nDamage & Control\nPieces start off fresh—ships are fresh when standing upright,\nand buildings are fresh on their fully colored side.\n\nTip Ship or Flip\nBuilding to Damage\n\nVS\nRed Has Control\n\nBy battling, fresh pieces can become damaged, shown by\nflipping or tipping it over. If a damaged piece is damaged\nagain, it is destroyed, removing it from the map.\nYou control a system and its contents if you have more fresh\nships there than each Rival (other player). On a tie, no one\ncontrols the system.\nControlling a system lets you tax Rival cities there and capture\ntheir agents, restricts how their ships move, and damages\npieces they build (pages 12–13).\n\nTrophies & Captives\nIf you destroy a Rival’s pieces, put them in the Trophies box\non your player board. Trophies add to the Warlord ambition.\nActions such as Battle (page 14) let you destroy Rival pieces.\n\nTaking a Trophy\n\nIf you capture a Rival’s agents, put them in the Captives box\non your player board. Captives add to the Tyrant ambition.\nActions such as Tax (page 12) and Secure (page 13) let you\ncapture Rival agents.\n\n•7\n\n\fPlaying a Chapter \b\nA game of Arcs lasts up to 5 chapters. In each chapter, you\nplay some number of rounds. In a round, each player takes\none turn, starting with the player with the initiative marker.\nBroadly, on your turn, you must play 1 action card, which lets\nyou take one or more actions.\nAt the end of the round, the initiative marker might go to a\nnew player based on which cards were played.\nKeep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards.\nAt this point, the chapter ends (page 18).\n\nStep 1: Player with Initiative\nTakes Turn\nAs the player with initiative, you must play one action card\nface up as the lead card. You may take one action (pages\n12–16) for each action pip on the lead card based on its suit:\n\n• Administration pips can tax, repair, or influence.\n• Aggression pips can battle, move, or secure.\n• Construction pips can build or repair.\n• Mobilization pips can move or influence.\nPlace the card in the “Lead“ card slot on the left map edge, so\nplayers can reference it during the round.\n\n4\n\nInitiative\n\nPassing Initiative\n\n3\n4\nBuild\nor Repair\nBuild or\nRepair\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nBuild or Repair\n\n4\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nCONSTRUCTION\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nSuit\n\nAction Pips\n\nIf you have the initiative, but you have no cards in your hand\nor just choose to skip your turn, you must pass the initiative.\nWhen you pass the initiative, give the initiative marker to\nthe next clockwise player who has any cards in their hand,\nthen immediately end the round. The player who now has\ninitiative will play the lead card of the new round.\nIf everyone with cards in their hand passes consecutively,\ndiscard all action cards and end the chapter (page 18).\n\n8•\n\nMikah has the initiative, so she\nplays the lead card. She plays\na Construction card, which\nlets her build or repair.\nThis card has 3 action pips.\nShe spends one to build,\none to repair, and chooses\nnot to take a third action.\n\n\fDeclaring an Ambition\nIf you have the initiative, you may declare the ambition\nshown on your lead card before taking any actions:\n\n• The “1” cards have no ambition. (Four players only.)\n• The “2” through 6” cards let you declare the\n•\n\nThen she covers the card\nnumber on her card with the\nzero marker, setting it to 0.\nShe still gets 3 action pips!\n\nZero Marker\n\nCard Number\nWarlord Symbol\n\n4\nBuild or Repair\n\nShe places the available\nambition marker worth the\nmost Power into the Warlord\nambition box on the map.\n\n4\n\nYou cannot declare an ambition if all ambitions markers are\nalready placed.\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBefore taking her actions,\nMikah declares the Warlord\nambition on her card.\n\nPlace the zero marker onto the lead card to cover the card\nnumber in its top-left corner—its card number is now 0.\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nDeclaring does not change your\ncard’s number of action pips.\n\n4\n\nTake the highest-number ambition marker from the Available\nMarkers section on the right map edge, and place it in the\nambition box of the declared ambition.\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nYou cannot declare an\nambition multiple times\nusing the same card.\n\nmatching ambition. (They are listed on page 18.)\nThe “7” cards let you declare any ambition.\n(Four players only.)\n\nCONSTRUCTION\nBuild or Repair\n\nYou can even declare an ambition\nthat was declared in an earlier\nround! Just place another\nambition marker in its box.\n\nAmbition Marker\n\n»\n\n•9\n\n\fStep 2: Other Players\nTake Turns\nAfter the player with initiative takes their turn, each other\nplayer in clockwise order takes a turn. Players with no cards in\ntheir hand skip their turn.\nOn your turn, you must play an action card in one of three ways:\n\n• Surpass: Play an action card face up of the lead\n\n•\n•\n\ncard’s suit. Its card number must be higher\nthan the lead card. You may take actions up to\nthe number of action pips on your card.\nCopy: Play any action card face down. You\nmay take only one action of the lead card.\nPivot: Play an action card face up that is not of\nthe lead card’s suit. It can have any card number.\nYou may take only one action on your card.\n\nSurpassing only needs a\ncard higher than the lead\ncard, not all played cards!\n\nPivoting does not\nchange the lead suit.\n\nPlace the card in the “Surpass, Copy, or Pivot“ card slot on the\nleft map edge, so players can reference it during the round.\n\nSeizing the Initiative\nWhen you play a card, before taking any actions, you can\nseize the initiative marker from the player who holds it.\nThere are two ways to do this:\n\n• You may choose to play an extra action card.\n•\n\nPlace it face down beside the card you played\nas a reminder. You do not get actions for it.\nYou Surpass with a “7” action card. You still get to take\nits actions. (Only four-player games have “7” cards.)\n\nTake the initiative marker and lay it down to show it is seized.\nFor the rest of this round, players cannot seize the initiative.\nThe player with initiative cannot seize the initiative.\n10 •\n\n2\n7\nMove or Inﬂuence\n\nBuild or Repair\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBuild or Repair\n\n5\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nLotus takes the next turn by\nplaying a “5” Construction\ncard. It matches the lead suit\nof Construction and its card\nnumber is higher than "0," so\nthey Surpass and build twice.\n\nMOBILIZATION\n\n5\n\nSurpass - 2 Actions!\n\nAGGRESSION\n\nAGGRESSION\n\nBattle or Move or Secure\n\n2\n\nAGGRESSION\n\nBattle or Move or Secure\n\nAfter Mikah played her\nConstruction card to lead the\nround, Dane takes his turn. He\nplays an Aggression card to\nPivot and chooses to move.\n\nBattle or Move or Secure\n\n2\n\nPivot - 1 Action!\n\nTo Surpass, you must\nmatch the lead suit!\nIf the initiative is seized, you can\nstill Surpass with a “7” card—you\njust won’t seize the initiative.\n\n?\n\n\fStep 3: Check Initiative\nAfter everyone has taken a turn, check whether the initiative\nmarker goes to a new player.\nIf no one seized the initiative this round, give the initiative to\nthe player who Surpassed with the highest card number.\nIf no one Surpassed, the initiative stays with its holder.\nIf someone seized the initiative this round, that player keeps\nthe initiative.\n\nBuild or Repair\n\n>\n\n4\nCONSTRUCTION\n\n5\nBuild or Repair\n\nNobody seized the\ninitiative, so Lotus takes\nthe initiative marker.\n\nCard Number\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nLotus played the highest\nConstruction card to\nSurpass this round.\n\nStep 4: Discard Cards &\nCheck for New Round\nDiscard all played action cards, and any action card used to\nseize the initiative, into the action discard pile on the map\nface down.\nIf any players have any action cards left in their hand, start the\nnext round. Otherwise, end the chapter (page 18).\n\n• 11\n\n\fStandard Actions \b\nTax (administration)\nChoose a Loyal city or choose a Rival city you control.\n\nLoyal pieces are your color.\n\nGain 1 resource of the city’s planet type from the supply.\n\nRival pieces are other\nplayers’ colors.\n\nIf you tax a Rival city, you also capture 1 agent of that Rival\nfrom their supply, even if you didn’t gain the resource.\nTax Limit: You cannot tax a city more than once per turn.\nCaptives: Place captured agents in the Captives box on your\nplayer board.

Because she taxed\nDane’s city, she places 1\nagent from Dane’s supply\ninto her Captives box.\n\nBuild (construction)\nYou may build a building or a ship:\n\n• Building: Place 1 starport or city in an empty building\n•\n\nslot in a system with a Loyal piece. When building\na city, use the leftmost city on your player board.\nShip: Place 1 ship at a Loyal starport.\nEach starport can only build one ship per turn.\n\nWhen you build anything in a system that is controlled by\nanyone other than you, place the piece damaged.\n\nDamaged ships are tipped over,\nand damaged buildings are\nflipped to their darker side.\nDane builds twice. First, he\nbuilds a starport at a planet\nwhere he has a ship.\nThen he builds a ship. He can\nplace the ship at any of his\nstarports, so he places it at\nthe starport he just built.\n\n12 •\n\n\fMove (Mobilization & Aggression)\nA system can be a gate\nor a planet (page 6).\n\nMove any number of Loyal ships from one system to an\nadjacent system.\n\nSystems sharing a single\nthin border are adjacent.\n\nIf you move from a system with a Loyal starport, you may\ntake Catapult moves—keep moving the ships as much as you\nwant, dropping them off as you want, until they move to a\ngate controlled by anyone else or they move to any planet.\n\nWhen you take a Catapult\nmove, check for control\nbefore moving in, not after.\nYou can’t Catapult from Rival\nstarports you control.\n\nOut-of-Play Clusters: You cannot move into any systems in\nout-of-play clusters. The path marker placed on out-of-play\ngates makes its two neighboring gates adjacent.\n\nLotus moves 2 Loyal ships\nfrom a Loyal starport, so they\ntake Catapult moves.\nThey move from the planet\ninto the "4" gate. Normally\nthey would end the move\nhere, but the Catapult\nlets them move more.\nThey move through the path to\nthe "5" gate, but it is controlled\nby Mikah, so they stop moving.\nLotus will have to take another\nMove action to keep moving.\n\nRepair (Construction & Administration)\nStand up 1 damaged Loyal ship, or flip over 1 damaged Loyal\nbuilding.

Discard all resources and Guild\ncards you have of that city’s planet type, placing the\ndiscarded cards in a face-up Court discard pile near the\nCourt deck. Place an agent to cover the Outrage icon\nof that city’s planet type on your player board—that\nresource is now Outraged­(see below).\n2. Ransack the Court. Secure any card that has any\nnumber of the defender’s agents. Take all Rival agents\non the card as Trophies, not Captives.\nOutrage: You cannot spend Outraged resources for their\nnormal Prelude action (page 17).\n\nIf you have no Loyal agents,\nuse a placeholder piece until\nan agent becomes available.\nIf you already have Outrage of\nthe city’s type, perform both\nsteps except placing the agent.\n\nYou can still tax Outraged\nresources and add them\nto your ambitions.\n\nBecause she destroyed a Relic\ncity, Mikah discards all her Relics\nand Relic Guild cards, then covers\nher Relic icon with an agent.\n\n+\n\nThen, Mikah takes a card from the\nCourt where Lotus has 1 agent.\nShe takes all 3 Rival agents there\ninto her Trophies box. Finally,\nshe draws a card from the Court\ndeck to refill the Court row.\n\nArms Union\nPrelude: You may\nplace this card\nnext to\na face-up playe\nd Aggression card\n.

Have the most total Fuel and Material\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nicons from resources and Guild cards.\nTyrant. Have the most Captives on your player\nboard (gained from taxing and securing).\nWarlord. Have the most Trophies on your\nplayer board (gained in battle).\nKeeper. Have the most Relic icons\nfrom resources and Guild cards.\nEmpath. Have the most Psionic icons\nfrom resources and Guild cards.\n\nTycoon Ambition Box\n\nTrophies and Captives Boxes\nFirst Place\n\nThe player who gets first place for the ambition gains the\nhigher Power shown on all its ambition markers.\nThe player who gets second place for it gains the lower\nPower shown on all its ambition markers.\nShow the Power you gained by advancing your Power marker\non the Power track on the bottom edge of the map.\n\nSecond Place\nor Tied for First\n\nTies: On a tie for first place, all tied players get second place.\nOn a tie for second place, the tied players do not place and\ngain no Power.\nQualifying: You cannot gain Power from an ambition if you\nhave none of the thing it is counting. (For example, if Warlord\nis declared and nobody has Trophies, nobody gains Power.)\nBonus City Power: Each time you get first place in an\nambition (not tied), gain 2 extra Power if the “+2 to won\nambitions” city slot on your player board is uncovered, or gain\n5 extra if both the “+2 to won ambitions” and “+3 to won\nambitions” city slots on your player board are uncovered.\n\nX\nVS\n18 •\n\nBonus City Power\n\nYou can only gain bonus\nPower once per ambition,\nregardless of how many\nambition markers it has.\nTycoon is worth 7 Power. Mikah\nhas 1 Fuel and 1 Material Guild\ncard, and Dane has 2 Material.\nThey tie and each gain 3 Power.\nMikah could have gained\n2 more Power from her +2 to\nWon Ambitions slot, but does\nnot because she tied for first.\n\n\fTwo-Player Scoring\nDuring setup with 2 players, 6 resources matching the planets\nwith out-of-play markers are placed on the ambition boxes.\nFor scoring, count these resources as if a third player had\nthem. Weapons on the Warlord box count as Trophies.\nOtherwise, these resources are out of play.\n\nStep 2: Clean Up\n& Flip Ambition\nIf Warlord was scored, return all Trophies. If Tyrant was\nscored, return all Captives.\nStarports and ships return\nto their players’ supplies.\nCities return to the rightmost\nempty city slot on their\noriginal player boards.\n\nReturn all ambition markers to the Available Markers spaces\non the map.\nFlip over the ambition marker with the lowest Power that\nhasn’t been flipped yet to its side with more Power.\n\nStep 3: End Game or\nAdvance Chapter\nThe game ends if any player has at least 27 Power\n(4 players), 30 Power (3 players), or 33 Power (2 players),\nor if the chapter marker is currently on Chapter 5.\nIf the game ends, the player with the most Power is the\nwinner. On a tie, the tied player earliest in turn order\nis the winner.\nIf the game does not end, advance the chapter marker\nto the next space.\n\nStep 4: Draw Cards\nShuffle all of the action cards. Each player draws a hand of\n6 action cards.\nDiscard all action cards not in players’ hands into the action\ndiscard pile on the map face down.\nSix Cards!\n\nThe player with initiative starts the next chapter!\n\nTwo-Player Mulligans\nIn games with 2 players, after drawing, the player without\ninitiative may discard their hand of 6 action cards to draw a\nnew hand of 6 action cards. They must accept this new hand.\n\n• 19\n\n\fOther Actions \b\nPrelude Actions\nMany cards and all resources (page 17) give Prelude actions.\nOn cards, these actions begin with “Prelude:“\nYour Prelude begins once you play an action card and ends\nonce you spend an action pip from your played card. You can\ntake any number of Prelude actions, with two limits:\n\n• Resources spent in Prelude return to the\n•\n\nsupply at the end of your Prelude, so\nyou cannot regain them until then.\nYou cannot use Prelude actions on cards that you\nsecured from the Court in the same Prelude.\n\nSome Prelude actions on cards make you discard the card.\nPlace it in a face-up Court discard pile near the Court deck.\n\nNew Actions\nCards can give you a new action followed by the name of a\nstandard action in parentheses, such as Assassinate (Battle).\nWhen you would take the standard action by spending an\naction pip or a non-Outraged resource, you may instead take\nthe new action.\n\nModifiers\nCards can give you modifiers to standard actions, which\nare shown in bold, such as “In battle, collect 1 extra die.“\nModifiers do not modify new actions, but they do modify\nstandard actions that are within new actions.\nModifiers can also affect critical play steps, such as setup\n(pages 4–5), scoring (Step 1, page 18), declare an ambition\n(page 9), and seize the initiative (page 10).\n\n20 •\n\nAdmin Union\nAdmin Union\nPrelude: You may place this card next\nPrelude: You\nmay place\nthis card next card.\nto a face-up\nplayed\nAdministration\nto a face-up played Administration card.\nWhen\nthe\nround\nends,\ndraw\nthat card\nWhen the round ends, draw that card\ninto your\nhand\nthis\ncard.\ninto your\nhandand\nand discard\ndiscard this\ncard.\n\nBC\n\nBC\n\nGUILD\n\nGUILD\n\n04\n\n04\n\nBefore Prelude actions, you must\nchoose whether or not to declare\nan ambition or seize the initiative.\n\nFor example, if you spend an\naction pip to take the Battle\naction, you can Assassinate\ninstead. You can even do\nthis if you spent a Weapon in\nyour Prelude to allow this.\n\nFor example, the Living\nStructures lore card says\n"Nurture (Build): Tax a Loyal\ncity." In this case, build modifiers\ndo not modify Nurture, but\ntax modifiers do modify the\nTax action it contains.\n\n\fLeaders & Lore \b\nAfter playing a game or two, you’re ready to play with\nLeaders and Lore! This mode gives players wild, unique\nabilities, but they can be hard to handle if you’re starting out.\nReally, don’t play your first game with Leaders and Lore.\nTool-Priests\n\n• Your leader card gives you unique powers,\n\nSummon (Build): Once per turn, build\n1 ship at any city you control.\nYes, even Rival cities you control!\n\nL\n\nLORE\n\n•\n\n01\n\nLore Card\n\nstarting pieces, and starting resources.\nLore cards give persistent powers. They don’t\nhave a guild icon or raid cost, so they do not\nadd to ambitions and cannot be stolen.\n\nSetup\nReplace Steps N–O of setup (page 5) with02\nthe following:\n02\n\nLay out lore cards and leader cards in face-up rows, each\nwith cards equal to the players plus one.\nIn reverse turn order—start with the player to the right of the\nplayer with initiative, and go counterclockwise—each player\nmay take 1 leader or lore card.\nContinue this until each player has 1 leader card and 1 lore\ncard. You cannot take a leader card if you already have one,\nand you cannot take a lore card if you already have one.\n\nMystic\nAttuned.

Be careful!\n\nIf you want to increase chaos and uniqueness even more, you\ncan let players choose a second lore card. Just add 1 extra\nlore card per player to the starting row, and keep choosing\ncards until each player has 1 leader card and 2 lore cards.\n\n• 21\n\n\fFine Print \b\nThis section covers some technical parts of play.\n\nRules Hierarchy\n\nTiebreakers &\nChoice Order\n\nThis rulebook supersedes the aid sheets and\nplayer boards.\n\nIf you have a tie and its tiebreaker is not\nspecified, break the tie in turn order. Likewise,\nif players must make a decision in an unclear\norder, resolve it in turn order. (Start with the\nplayer with initiative and go clockwise.)\nIf multiple things happen at the same time but\nmust be resolved in order, the player taking\ntheir turn chooses their order. If no one is taking\na turn, the player with initiative chooses.\n\nElimination &\nConcession\nRarely, a player will have no starports or ships\non the map. If this happens, they place 3 fresh\nships in any gate at the end of their turn.\nSometimes, usually in games with 2 players, it\nmay become clear that a player has won. Feel\nfree to concede!\n\nPieces & Piece Limits\nPieces are limited by the contents of the box\nwith one exception: if you need an agent to\nplace on an Outrage slot but none are in your\nsupply, use a placeholder piece until an agent\nenters your supply, then place the agent.\nIf a rule makes you place pieces, this refers to\nfresh Loyal pieces by default.\nPieces that you place and return come from and\ngo to their original supply by default except for\ncities: cities come from and go to the rightmost\nempty city slot on their original player board.\n(Remember, pieces often go to Trophies and\nCaptives instead of back to supplies.)\nIf you must place or return more pieces than\npossible, do the maximum possible.\nIf you replace a piece, return it and place\nanother piece in its place. If the old piece was\ndamaged, the new piece is placed damaged.\n(Replacing a piece does not destroy it.)\n\n22 •\n\nCards supersede this rulebook, but any rule that\nuses the term cannot is absolute—it cannot be\nsuperseded unless explicitly named using the\nterm ignore. (For example, “You ignore Outrage\nwhen spending Material for its Prelude action.”)\nSidebars as well as text written in italics and\nparentheses (like this) are clarifications and\nreminders, which are superseded by the core\nrules they reference.\n\nNegotiations\nPlayers may make deals and promises, but they\nare not binding. Players cannot give each other\npieces unless a rule allows it.\n\nPrivate Information\nPlayers cannot show the action cards in their\nhand to anyone else.\n\nTurn Etiquette\nThough declaring an ambition and seizing the\ninitiative happen before any other actions, we\nusually let people do them during their turn as\nlong as new info hasn’t been revealed—such as\nrolling dice or drawing a card—and any relevant\nmodifiers are followed. Don’t get bogged down\nin technicalities unless it changes the game.\nArcs thrives when the game flows!\n\nSplit Discard Piles\nNormally, all action cards are discarded face\ndown, even ones played face up. This speeds\nup play but it favors players with good memory.\nIf you’re running a tournament or want a more\nstrategic but slower game, you can split the action\ndiscard into two piles—one for cards played face\ndown, and one for cards played face up.\nIf you’re prompted to draw from the action\ndiscard pile, draw from the facedown pile.\nIn the rare circumstance that it doesn’t have\nenough cards, shuffle the piles together first.\n\n\fGlossary \b\nAdjacent: Shares a thin border (The Map, page 6).\nBuilding: Cities and starports.\nBury: Place on the bottom of the Court deck.\nCapture: Place the prompted piece in the Captives\nbox on your player board.\nChapter: The time in which players play rounds until\nthey all run out of action cards.\nClear: Return all pieces from the prompted area.\nControl: You control a system and its contents if you\nhave more fresh ships there than each Rival.

The Empire is crumbling. The Blight is spreading through the Reach, destroying\neverything it touches. What is it? What does it want?\nSome believe this is the end. Others, just the beginning. In this time of chaos, new movements bloom\nloud like desert flowers, promising safety, liberation, communion, or simply the honor of glorious\ndeath in the struggle. What will you promise? What is your Fate?\nWe strongly recommend you play at least one game of single-session Arcs before the campaign.\nAll players should be comfy with the base game.

Set Up Players\nA. Each player chooses a color, collects\nthe player board, 15 ships, 5 cities,\n5 starports, and 10 agents of that color,\nand places those cities in the 5 triangle\nslots along the top of their player board.\nB. Each player draws 2 “A” Fate cards\n(“A” on card back) and chooses one secretly.\nAfter everyone chooses, reveal them and\ntake the matching Fate Sets (page 2).\nC. Each player sets up based on the\nSetup side of their objective card—the\nfirst card in their Fate Set—then flips\nthe card to its Objective side.\nD. Each player places their objective marker\non the Power track space shown by the\nlarge clock on their objective card.\nE.

Shuffle the Court deck and deal\n3 cards (2 players) or 4 cards (3–4\nplayers) from it into the Court. Flip the\nImperial Council card to In Session.\nC. Place 1 damaged Blight on each gate\nthat has no Blight and no ships.\nD. Roll the event die. In each cluster, place\n1 damaged Blight at the planet with the\nrolled ID symbol if it has no Blight. If it does\nhave Blight, place 1 damaged Blight at\neach planet in its cluster with no Blight.\nE. 2 Players Only: Roll the number die twice.\nPlace the 6 resource tokens matching\n\nthe planets in the 2 rolled clusters onto\nambition boxes as in Step Q of Table\nSetup in Act I. (If the resource supply\nempties, just place as much as you can.)\nF. Each player sets up using the Setup side\nof their objective card, then flips it to\nits Objective side. Each player may also\nrearrange their resource tokens. If multiple\nplayers must make setup choices, resolve\nthem in turn order. (To speed up setup,\nfeel free to do all this simultaneously!)\nG. Each player places their objective marker\non the Power track space as shown at the\ntop of their objective card. In Act III, only\nplayers with a “C” Fate do this step.\nH.

Instead, Acts I and II\nend after 3 chapters, and Act III ends after 4 chapters.\n• Don’t end an Act early if a player gains enough\nPower. Ignore the thresholds on the Power track.\nWhile setting up Act I, you choose an ”A” Fate. You might\nplay this Fate for all three Acts or switch to a new one.\n• If you switch Fate after Act I, you’ll choose a ”B” Fate.\n• If you switch Fate after Act II, you’ll choose a ”C” Fate.\nAt the end of Act III, the winner is the player with the most\nPower accumulated over all three Acts. Break a Power tie in\nfavor of “A” Fates over “B” Fates, and “B” Fates over “C” Fates.\nBreak a further tie in turn order.\nYou can also win by completing a final objective (page 9).\n\nChapter\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\nAct\nI & II\n\nThe chapter track tile covers the\ntrack used in the single-session\ngame. Use one side in Acts I and\nII, and use the other in Act III.\nIn Acts II and III, you may need\nto track large amounts of Power.\nUse the second Power marker\nincluded in the base game to\nmark the “+50” or “+100” space\nnear the Power track to show this.\n\nObjective\nIn Acts I and II, your Fate gives you an objective.\nDuring setup, place your objective marker on the starting\nspace on the Power track shown at the top of your objective\ncard. Sometimes, the starting space changes based on the\nnumber of players, shown by the symbols.\n\nFounder - Act I\n\nYour objective card gives you ways to advance your objective\nmarker, moving it down the Power track toward 0 Power.\nWhen it reaches 0 Power, you complete your objective!\n\n14-18\n\nAdmiral - Act I\n\nStarting Space\n\nFounder - Act I\n\n14-18\n/\n\n: 16\n\n/\n\n: 14\n\nWhile you’re an Outlaw, advance\n3 for each ambition you win.\nDefy the Empire’s Grip\n\nWhile you’re an Outlaw, advance\n3 for each ambition you win.\n\nAt the end of a chapter, if you’re an\nOutlaw, advance 1 for each\nsystem you control.\n» You can become an Outlaw\nwhen you call a Summit or\nwhen you declare an ambition,\nusing your Parade Fleets card.\n\nDefy the Empire’s Grip\nAt the end of a chapter, if you’re an\nOutlaw, advance 1 for each\nsystem you control.\n» You can become an Outlaw\nwhen you call a Summit or\nwhen you declare an ambition,\nusing your Parade Fleets card.\n\nIntermission\n\nF2\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\n01\n\nAfter Acts I and II, there is an Intermission.

These give you more ways to gain Power\nand do not use the objective marker.\nAt the end of a chapter, grand ambitions are scored at the\nsame time as declared ambitions.\nIf you fulfilled one grand ambition, gain the lower amount of\nPower shown under the current chapter on the Chapter track.\nIf you fulfilled both, gain the higher amount.\nYour grand ambitions are always active—you do not need to\ndeclare them.

You can use one side for Edict\ncards and the other side for Law and Summit cards.\nIn rare cases where you run out of space on one side for a\nspecific card type, you can use the other side.\nAs you add cards to this booklet, make sure to explain them\naloud, since these rules affect everyone.\n\n•9\n\nAc\nI\n\n\fThe Empire \b\nEveryone starts as a Regent of a crumbling galactic Empire,\nshown by their Regent title card tucked into their Fate card.\nOne Regent is the First Regent, who governs the Empire\n(page 20) and holds the Imperial Trust (page 21), resources\nthey collect from Regents as tribute for the distant Emperor.\nA Regent can become an Outlaw by calling a Summit (page\n16). Outlaws can be attacked by the Empire, but they can\nbattle Regents freely and don’t pay into the Imperial Trust.\n\nControl & Command\nThe Empire controls all systems that have any number of\nfresh Imperial ships, ignoring all players’ Loyal ships.\nThe First Regent controls all Empire-controlled systems for\nthe purpose of ambitions, objectives, and events (page 12).\nOn a Regent’s turn, they Command the Imperial Fleet\nfollowing the Presence Law: In systems with Loyal pieces,\nthey control the system if it is Empire-controlled and can take\nactions with Imperial ships there—move and repair them,\nbattle with them, build at them, and tax cities they control.\nIf a rule lets you ignore the Presence Law, you Command the\nImperial Fleet in all systems, even those with no Loyal pieces.\n\nImperial\nRegent\nTuck this partially under your Fate card.\nYou must follow the rules for Regents\nlisted on the Empire Rules aid sheet.\nYou can become an Outlaw, flipping this\ntitle over, if you call a Summit.\n\nRegent Title Card\n\nTITLE\n\n06\n\nThe Empire controls systems\nwith just one Imperial ship.\n\nPresence Law: To Command\nImperial ships, Regents need\nLoyal pieces in the system—\npieces of their player color.\nAn Outlaw has 4 fresh Loyal\nships in a system. A Regent\nhas 2 fresh Loyal ships there.\n\nOutlaw\n\nRegent\n\nImperial\n\nRegardless of all these ships,\n1 fresh Imperial ship is there,\nso the Empire controls it.\nOn the Regent’s turn, they\ncontrol the system. On the\nOutlaw’s turn, the system is\ncontrolled by the Empire, so\nthey build pieces damaged.\n\nMovement\nRegents also follow the Movement Law: Regents can only\nmove 1 Imperial ship for each Loyal ship they are moving\nalong with them at the same time to the same system.\n• Empire control of gates ends the Catapult moves of\nOutlaw pieces, but not Regent or Imperial pieces.\n• Regent control of gates ends the Catapult moves of\nOutlaw pieces and Rival Regent pieces alone, but not\nImperial pieces or mixed Regent and Imperial pieces.\n• Outlaw control of gates ends the Catapult\nmoves of Regent and Imperial ships alike.\n10 •\n\nMovement Law: Imperial ships\ndon’t move alone. Each one\nneeds a moving Loyal ship.\nRival means it has another\nplayer’s color.\nMost of the time, you take\nCatapult moves when you\nmove from a Loyal starport.\n\n\fA Regent takes a Catapult move,\nmoving 2 Imperial and 3 Loyal\nships, dropping off 1 Loyal ship.\nNext, they move 2 Imperial\nand 2 Loyal ships, dropping\noff 1 Imperial ship.\nThey finish their Catapult\nmove by moving 1 Imperial\nand 2 Loyal ships.\n\nBattle, Harm, & Taxing\n\nTruce Law: Imperial ships\nprotect Regents from harming\nand taxing each other.\nHarm means “battle, hit,\ndamage, or destroy” (page 27).\nThe Truce Law does not limit\nCrises (page 18) in any way.\n\nTo hit a Regent’s buildings with\n, an Outlaw must destroy all\ndefending ships, even Imperials.\n\nFinally, Regents follow the Truce Law: Regents cannot harm\nImperial ships except for hits they take as attacking ships in\nbattle, and they cannot harm or tax Rival Regents in systems\nwith Imperial ships.\nWhen a Regent attacks in battle, they may add Imperial ships\nin the battle system to their attacking ships.\nWhen a Regent defends in battle, they must add Imperial\nships in the battle system to their defending ships.\n\nOutlaw Battles\nOutlaws may choose either a Regent or the Empire as\ndefender.\nIf the Empire is defending, the defending pieces are the\nImperial ships in the battle system, and the First Regent takes\nany destroyed pieces of the Outlaw as Trophies. If there is no\nFirst Regent, they return to the Outlaw.\n\nIf the Outlaw battles the\nRegent, the Regent adds\nthe Imperial ship, so they\nhave 3 defending ships.\n\nRegent + Imperial...\n\nIf the Outlaw battles the Empire,\nthe Empire has 1 defending ship.\nIf the Regent battles the Outlaw,\nthe Regent may add the Imperial\nship to their 2 Loyal ships.\n\nOutlaw\n\n...or Imperial Only\n\n• 11\n\n\fEvents \b\nThere are three kinds of events: Summits, Crises, and Edicts.\nDuring a Summit, players can make deals to\nexchange pieces and favors in a freeform manner.\nDuring the Crises, the Blight attacks ships on the\nmap, and some Guild and Vox cards cause chaos.\nDuring the Edicts, the First Regent governs the\nEmpire. Over time, more Edicts are added.\nEvents can be triggered by playing an Event card or securing\nthe Imperial Council card from the Court (page 14).\n\nEvent Cards\n\nWhen you play it, you may take actions exactly like you\nplayed the lead card.\nHowever, your Event card gives you no actions if a Rival\nplayed another Event card earlier this round or secured the\nImperial Council earlier this round (page 14)!\nTwo-Player Mulligans: When you take a mulligan in a twoplayer game, you must keep any Event cards in your hand and\nonly draw the number of action cards you discarded.\n\nEvent\n\nOn your turn, you may play an Event card. You cannot Lead\nit, Copy with it, or discard it to seize the initiative.\n\n!\nMirror Lead, Add Event to Round End\n\nEvent cards are a new kind of action card added during setup.\nThey cannot be scrapped.\n\nTake actions like the lead\ncard unless a Rival played\nan Event card or secured\nthe Imperial Council this\nround.\nYou cannot Lead this,\nCopy with this, or discard\nthis to seize the initiative .\nAt the end of the round,\nafter checking initiative,\nthe player with initiative\nmay call a Summit, then\nmust roll an event.\n: Resolve Crises.\n: Resolve Edicts.\nIf the Imperial Council\nwas secured this round,\nresolve it instead of this.\n\nIf you have the initiative and\nonly have Event cards, you\nmust pass the initiative.\nIf you play an event that\ngives you no actions, you can\nstill take Prelude actions.\n\nLotus plays a “2” Construction\ncard as the lead card.\nDane plays an Event, so he can\ntake 4 Construction actions.\nNext, Mikah also plays an Event,\nbut she gets no actions from it.\n\n12 •\n\n\fResolving the Event\nIf multiple Event cards were\nplayed, only resolve one.\n\nAt the end of a round where any Event cards were played, do\nthe following just after checking whether initiative changes:\n\nRoll the event and number dice\neven if a Summit was not called.\n\nThe player with initiative may call the Summit (page 16).\nThen, they roll the event and number dice and resolve the\nevent die as follows:\n\nFor now, ignore the number die\nand the , , and planet ID\nsymbols on the event die. They\nare used in Crises (page 18).\n\n• If\n• If\n\nis rolled, resolve Crises (page 18).\nis rolled, resolve Edicts (page 20).\n\nImperial Council: If the Imperial Council (page 14) is secured\nduring the same round as any Event cards are played, resolve\nthe Council and do not resolve the Event card.\nDane and Mikah played\nEvent cards and did not\nseize the initiative, so Lotus\nkeeps the initiative.\nLotus calls the Summit. After\nit, they roll the event die and\nnumber dice, triggering Crises!\n\n• 13\n\n\fImperial Council \b\nThe Imperial Council is a card in the Court with two sides:\nIn Session and Decided. In each Act, it starts In Session.\nWhile the Imperial Council is In Session, players may\ninfluence and secure it.\nThe Imperial Council cannot be buried, scrapped, or\ndiscarded.\n\nSecuring the Council\n\nImperial Council\nin Session\nWhen Secured: Flip this card over to\nits Imperial Council Decided side. As\na reminder, tuck it partially under your\nplayed card so its card title is showing.\n\nIMPERIAL COUNCIL\n\n01\n\nCards can be attached (page\n27) to the Council, even if it’s\nflipped to Decided, and cards\nlike Court Enforcers do affect it.\n\nWhen you secure the Council, flip it to Decided and tuck it\nunder your played card as a reminder to resolve it later.\nAt the end of that round, return the Imperial Council card to\nthe Court on its Decided side, then resolve the following:\n1. You may call a Summit (page 16).\n2. If you’re a Regent, take the First Regent tile, keeping\nall resources on the Imperial Trust (page 21).\n3. If you’re an Outlaw, steal resources from the Imperial\nTrust on the First Regent tile, up to your number of\nempty resource slots. The First Regent loses 1 Power\nfor each resource stolen.\n4. You must choose to resolve either the Crises (page 18)\nor the Edicts (page 20).\n\nThis is different from resolving\nan Event card in a couple ways:\nYou choose whether to\ncall the Summit, not the\nplayer with initiative.\nYou choose to resolve either\nthe Crises or Edicts, rather\nthan following the event die.\n\nEvent Cards: If the Imperial Council is secured in the same\nround as Event cards (page 12) are played, resolve the\nCouncil and ignore the Event cards.\nFirst\nRegent\n\nThese resources\nare frozen.\n\n-3\nImperial\nTrust\n\nImperial Council Decided\nSecuring the Imperial Council flips it to its Decided side.\nWhile it is Decided, players cannot influence or secure it.\nIt flips back to In Session at the start of an Act (page 7), and\nyou can flip it to In Session if you call a Summit and Petition\nthe Council (page 16).\n\n14 •\n\nYou’re the First Regent and\nsecure the Council.

Take Free buildings you destroy as Trophies.\nBattling: If you choose the Free States as defender in battle,\nall Free buildings in the battle system are defending pieces.\nThey take hits from rolled dice like players’ buildings.\nRaiding: You may raid the Free States. You may gain exactly\n1 resource matching its planet type by spending\n. You\ncannot gain multiple resources from the Free States in the\nsame battle.\nEmpty Supply: In the rare event that you must place a Free\nbuilding but the supply is empty, use a proxy piece.\n\n• 15\n\n\fSummits \b\nEvent cards and the Imperial Council let players call the\nSummit. It has two parts: Call to Order, then Negotiations.\nBroadly, in the Call to Order you can return Favors—Rival\nagents you have collected on your Fate card—to your Rivals to\nforce them to take Negotiation actions, and you can interact\nwith Imperial politics.\nThen, in Negotiations, everyone can take Negotiation actions\nin a freeform manner, including giving each other Favors that\ncan be returned in later Summits.\n\nCall to Order\nThe player who called the Summit may take any number of\nCall to Order actions, listed below:\n• Return Favors: Return a Rival’s Favors to their supply\nto force them to take Negotiation actions (page 17)\nyou choose, targeting you, in the way you choose. By\ndefault, each Negotiation action you force costs 1 Favor.\n• Petition the Council: Flip the Imperial\nCouncil card to its In Session side.\n• Leave the Empire: Flip your Regent title card to Outlaw.\nIf you are the First Regent, give the First Regent\ntile to the Regent with the most Power. Resources\nstay in the Imperial Trust. If there are no Regents,\nreturn all resources from the Imperial Trust to\nthe supply, lose 1 Power per resource returned,\nand place the First Regent tile in the supply.\n• Revive the Empire: If there are no Regents, flip your\nOutlaw title card to Regent and take the First Regent tile.\n\nFlip your title card to Outlaw\nif you Leave the Empire.\nImperial\nRegent\nTuck this partially under your Fate card.\nYou must follow the rules for Regents\nlisted on the Empire Rules aid sheet.\n\n1\n\nYou can become an Outlaw, flipping this\ntitle over, if you call a Summit.\n\nTITLE\n\nSteward\n\n08\n\nHold together a fragmenting empire\nwhile navigating fractious court politics.\nYOUR PATH TO POWER\n\nI\n\nAssert your authority by winning\nambitions as the First Regent.\n\nII\n\nExtend the Empire’s control and\nfill the Imperial Trust.\nSolidify the Empire’s control over\n\nIII Outlaw cities and fill the Imperial\nTrust as the First Regent.\n\nComplexity:\n\nRival agents on your Fate\ncard are Favors.\nGenerally, you get Favors through\nNegotiations (page 17) and the\nImperial Demand (page 20).\n\nLotus calls the Summit to order.\nThey return two of Dane’s Favors\nto him to force him to give\nthem a Relic (Transfer Asset),\nsince it has a raid cost of 2!\nImperial Council\nDecided\nWhen the round ends, return Imperial\nCouncil Decided to the Court, then:\n1.

Then, everyone reveals their\nchosen Fate card simultaneously.\nIf you choose a new Fate card, do the following:\n• Return your current Fate card to the box.\n• Scrap the rest of your Fate Set that is not\nin play. Don’t scrap anything that is in play,\nincluding your Flagship if you have one!\n• Return all Favors you have to your Rivals.\n• Take the new Fate Set for your Fate from the box.\n\nNext Act?\nAt this point, discuss with everyone whether you want to play\nthe next Act or pack up the game so you can play it later.\nIf you are playing the next Act, set it up as described in\nAct II & III Setup (page 7).\nIf you are packing up, read Packing Up on the next page.\nNote that you won’t be able to play a single-session game of\nArcs until you finish the campaign or choose to abandon it!\n• 29\n\n\fPacking Up \b\nFor the next Act, preserve everything on the map, in the\ngeneral supply, and in everyone’s play areas as follows:\n• Use a log sheet to record your names, colors,\nFates, Power, Outrage, and Flagship Upgrades and\nArmor. If a Fate has you record more details, use\nthe blank spaces on the back of the log sheet.\n• Use the 2 map trays to store the pieces on the map.\nThe trays have sections for each planet (marked\nwith its ID symbol) and each gate (marked “G”).\n• If a system has too many pieces to fit in the tray, put an\noverflow marker in its tray section and put pieces from\nthe system in a bag with the matching overflow marker.\n• Use the 4 player trays to store the players’ play areas.\nIn your tray, use the large well to hold cards in play\nstacked on top of the cards remaining in your Fate Set.\nUse the small well to hold everything else in your play\narea except your player board and Flagship board.\nYou don’t need to track the order of your resources.\n• Keep all of the cards in the rules booklet.\n\nOrganizing the Box\nThe expansion box can fit everything from the base game.\nIt has 6 wells—a small well, 4 lower wells, and a deep well.\n\nPlayer Name & Color\nCampaign Log\n\nMikah I\nI\nSteward\nblue\n\nred\n\nyellow\n\nblue\n\n13\n\nwhite\n\nII\nIII\n\nII\nFate and Power\nin Act I\nred\n\nI\nII\n\nblue\n\nM,P C S\n\nIII\n\nRed\n\nyellow\n\nOutrage\nI\n\nFlagship\nPieces\n\nyellow\nII\n\nIII\n\nUse abbreviations—M for Material,\nwhite\nwhiteS for starport, etc.\nC for city,\nI\nII\nIII\n\nIII\n\nBase Game Tray\n\nThe small well fits the large Fate cards, the log sheet pad, and\nleader cards from the base game.\nThe 4 lower wells store small cards and unused Fate Sets.\n• Use dividers in these wells to store unused Fate Sets, the\naction deck, base and campaign Court decks, lore deck,\nsmall cards from the base game, and scrapped cards.\n• You may store the bags of pieces for Fate Sets with their\ncards behind their divider or in a separate well. If you\nsleeve cards, store the piece bags in a separate well.\n• Stack the game board, player boards, and\nFlagship boards on top of the lower wells.\n\nCampaign Game Tray\n\nThe deep well stores the 8 removable trays: 4 player trays,\n2 map trays, the base game tray, and the campaign game tray.\n• The base game and campaign trays can be packed in many\nways, but we recommend you pack them as shown to the\nright and use them during play to keep the table tidy.\n• Stack the base and campaign game trays in the deep\nwell, and stack the 4 player trays over them. Place one\nrulebook over them. Stack the 2 map trays over the\nrulebook.
