A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough Power—\nessentially points. In games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least 27 Power. With 3 players,\n30 Power. With 2 players, 33 Power. When the game ends, the player with the most Power wins.\nYou gain Power by completing ambitions, which are objectives that you declare in play. These are\nscored at the end of the chapter, when everyone runs out of action cards. The game lasts a varying\nnumber of chapters, usually three to five.\nYour first game of Arcs will take about 45 minutes per player. After you play a few times, a game\nshould take about 30 minutes per player.\nIf you want to learn Arcs by watching a video, you’ll find a link on the back cover of this rulebook!\n\n                                  What’s in the Box \b\n     Map\n\n\n\n\n                The map of the Reach is where the action happens.

After everyone takes a turn, players check\nwho gets initiative for the next round.

Planets\n     separated by a thick, irregular border are not adjacent.\n                                                                        Planet\nThe center of the map with the Arcs logo is not in play.              Cluster 4\nIn setup, 1 or 2 clusters are covered with out-of-play\nmarkers on its planets and a path marker on its gate. These\nclusters are out of play in every way.

In a round, each player takes\none turn, starting with the player with the initiative marker.\nBroadly, on your turn, you must play 1 action card, which lets\nyou take one or more actions.\nAt the end of the round, the initiative marker might go to a\nnew player based on which cards were played.\nKeep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards.\nAt this point, the chapter ends (page 18).\n\nStep 1: Player with Initiative\nTakes Turn\nAs the player with initiative, you must play one action card\nface up as the lead card. You may take one action (pages\n12–16) for each action pip on the lead card based on its suit:\n • Administration pips can tax, repair, or influence.\n • Aggression pips can battle, move, or secure.\n • Construction pips can build or repair.\n • Mobilization pips can move or influence.\nPlace the card in the “Lead“ card slot on the left map edge, so\nplayers can reference it during the round.\n\n       Suit\n                         4                                                                       Mikah has the initiative, so she\n                         4\n\n\n\n\n CONSTRUCTION\n       Build or Repair                                                                           plays the lead card.
