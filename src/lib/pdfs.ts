A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough Power—\nessentially points. In games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least 27 Power. With 3 players,\n30 Power. With 2 players, 33 Power. When the game ends, the player with the most Power wins.\nYou gain Power by completing ambitions, which are objectives that you declare in play. These are\nscored at the end of the chapter, when everyone runs out of action cards. The game lasts a varying\nnumber of chapters, usually three to five.\nYour first game of Arcs will take about 45 minutes per player. After you play a few times, a game\nshould take about 30 minutes per player.\nIf you want to learn Arcs by watching a video, you’ll find a link on the back cover of this rulebook!\n\n                                  What’s in the Box \b\n     Map\n\n\n\n\n                The map of the Reach is where the action happens.

After everyone takes a turn, players check\nwho gets initiative for the next round.

Planets\n     separated by a thick, irregular border are not adjacent.\n                                                                        Planet\nThe center of the map with the Arcs logo is not in play.              Cluster 4\nIn setup, 1 or 2 clusters are covered with out-of-play\nmarkers on its planets and a path marker on its gate. These\nclusters are out of play in every way.

In a round, each player takes\none turn, starting with the player with the initiative marker.\nBroadly, on your turn, you must play 1 action card, which lets\nyou take one or more actions.\nAt the end of the round, the initiative marker might go to a\nnew player based on which cards were played.\nKeep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards.\nAt this point, the chapter ends (page 18).\n\nStep 1: Player with Initiative\nTakes Turn\nAs the player with initiative, you must play one action card\nface up as the lead card. You may take one action (pages\n12–16) for each action pip on the lead card based on its suit:\n • Administration pips can tax, repair, or influence.\n • Aggression pips can battle, move, or secure.\n • Construction pips can build or repair.\n • Mobilization pips can move or influence.\nPlace the card in the “Lead“ card slot on the left map edge, so\nplayers can reference it during the round.\n\n       Suit\n                         4                                                                       Mikah has the initiative, so she\n                         4\n\n\n\n\n CONSTRUCTION\n       Build or Repair                                                                           plays the lead card.

You don\'t have to spend an action pip.\n\nQ: Can I use *Ruthless* to hit a building even if I do not gain a resource or cannot build a ship?\nA: Yes, you may hit a building to tax or build even if the action yields nothing.\n"\nQuartermaster,"Q: When does Resilient count the number of starports I control?\nA: Resilient checks the number of starports after battle.

For example, you cannot use Skirmishers to reroll the dice, and you cannot use Gatekeepers to collect more dice.\n"\nGate Stations,"Q: What happens if the cluster has no cities?\nA: If a Gate Station is in a cluster with no other city, it has no type. Destroying it provokes no Outrage. Taxing it yields no resource, but it can still be taxed.\n\nQ: What happens if this is transferred with Knowledge Set Free or scrapped from the Caretaker Act III Objective?\nA: If transferred, your cities in gates still operate in the same way. If scrapped, your cities in gates no longer have a type, so they no longer produce resources when taxed and no longer Provoke Outrage when destroyed.\n\nQ: If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have a city in the same gate?\nA: No, it is a maximum of one total.\n"\nGate Ports,"Q: What happens if this is transferred with Knowledge Set Free or scrapped from the Caretaker Act III Objective?\nA: Your starports in gates can still build ships and enable Catapult moves, but you can no longer take Captives with them.\n\nQ: If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have a starport in the same gate?\nA: No, it is a maximum of one total.\n"\nKeeper\'s Solidarity,"Q: How does this interact with Cartel cards?\nA: A player has the resources on Cartel cards. This means Keeper\'s Solidarity applies to those resources.\n"\nKeeper\'s Trust,"Q: Does this interact with Cartel cards?\nA: A player has the resources on Cartel cards. This means Keeper\'s Trust applies to those resources.\n"\nRaider Exosuits,"Q: When the defender has no buildings on the map and I could collect more than 1 raid die, am I restricted by Raider Exosuits?\nA: If the defender doesn\'t have any building on the map, you are not subject to the raid dice limit and can collect more than one raid die.\n"\nSignal Breaker,"Q: Can you limit which ships are battling?\nA: Attacker\'s Loyal ships in the battle system are all “attacking ships”. Therefore, all Loyal ships in the battle system must be fresh at the start of battle to use Signal Breaker.\n\nQ: Does Signal Break block the Intercept generated by Mirror Plating?\nA: Signal Breaker lets you “ignore one intercept you roll”. However, this cannot ignore the intercept added by Mirror Plating, because it is not rolled.\n\nQ: Does Signal Break take effect before Railgun Arrays?\nA: Signal Breaker checks if all the attacking ships are fresh at the beginning of the battle, before Railgun Arrays deals one hit.\n"\nSprinter Drives,"Q: Can Sprinter Drives activate more uses of Sprinter Drives?\nA: No, it is not recursive. The more verbose but correct text is: When you move fresh Loyal ships but not with Sprinter Drives, you may move any of them one more time.\n\nQ: Can the bonus move be a Catapult move?\nA: You can Catapult move with the bonus move.\n\nQ: If I catapult move and drop off ships in gates along my path, can each ship move again?\nA: Each fresh Loyal ship that moved can move one more time, independently and to a different destination.\n"\nTycoon\'s Ambition,"Q: If I have no Material or Fuel, can I use Tycoon\'s Ambition?\nA: You can use its ability even if you have zero Material and Fuel.\n\nQ: How does this interact with Material Cartel or Fuel Cartel?\nA: Nothing happens to the Material and Fuel on those cards.
