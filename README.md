Arcs Base Game, Leaders and Lore, and Campaign (Unofficial)

## Automatic setup

Shuffle the setup deck appropriate to the number of players and draw a card. Press "R" on it and everything will be laid out for you. If you prefer a specific setup card, press "R" on that instead.

If playing with Leaders and Lore, shuffle and draft whatever leader and lore cards you wish to use. Place these cards next to your player board before running the setup card.

## Playing

As you play action cards, click the Seize button below the appropriate card to seize the initiative marker. The Surpass button indicates which card will take initiative at the end of the round; press it at the end of the round to send the initiative marker to the player of the card. Press "R" on the initiative marker to manually take it for yourself or "Ctrl-R" to seize.

To take an extra action card from the bottom of the action discard pile, right click and select "Draw from bottom."

After a round, click Discard to discard to the holder and clean up the Ambition Declared marker and any resources. The default rotation of the holder is for face-up discard, which will automatically sort based on suit and rank and keep aside face down cards. For face-down discard behavior, rotate the holder by unlocking it (or switching to ground mode) and right-click and choose Toggle to face-down.

Click End Chapter to collect and shuffle all action cards. Press the Deal button below it to start a new chapter.

Press "R" to toggle ship damage. "F" will also stand them up. As you're dragging around pieces, pressing 1-9 can tidy them into compact groups of n rows.

Resource, card, and piece counts that contribute toward ambitions will tally under the ambition boxes on the map. Make sure to keep court cards in your play area for accuracy. Similarly, agents in the court show tallies too.

Rolling in the dice tray automatically sums results on screen. To dismiss the results, remove all dice from the tray.

Feel free to delete the post-it notes scattered about documenting hard-to-discover features. They'll be deleted along with campaign content after running a setup card.

## Campaign

All the Blighted Reach campaign content should be available. After choosing a Fate, press "R" on the Fate card to generate its corresponding set of cards and tokens. Campaign setup is currently manual.

## Philosophy

On the spectrum of skeuomorphic realism vs. video game adaptation, I prefer a realistic experience which tries to recreate what playing in real life is like. At the same time, I like to take advantage of what being in a video game world can afford. Meaning, I tend to implement features in an AR-like way, minimizing additional UI or hiding it within the naturally comfortable environment.

## Suggestions?

Just comment below and I'll definitely consider any ideas you have!

Shout out to Darrell's [other mod](https://mod.io/g/tabletopplayground/m/arcs1), which I learned from in building this one.

* Everywhere I say "Press R" I actually mean "run the primary action on the object", which by default is bound to R.
