		"1": "Overseer\n\nQ: Can I tax a city once per turn and build a ship in the same turn to use *Ruthless* twice?\nA: Each turn, you can only tax or build a ship with *Ruthless*, not both.\n\nQ: If a city is destroyed with *Ruthless*, when do I provoke Outrage?\nA: When you destroy a city to tax, you first provoke outrage, then gain the resource from taxing.\n\nQ: Does *Ruthless* give me an extra actions, or do the bonus activations of a city or startport counting against my total action pips?\nA: Hitting the building is an extra action. You don't have to spend an action pip.\n\nQ: Can I use *Ruthless* to hit a building even if I do not gain a resource or cannot build a ship?\nA: Yes, you may hit a building to tax or build even if the action yields nothing.",
		"2": "Corsair\n\nQ: Can I reroll this multiple times?\nA: No, only once.",
		"3": "Noble\n\nQ: If the top card of the Court deck is Populist Demands, do you trigger *Connected* again?\nA: Yes, if you declare an undeclared ambition with a drawn Populist Demands, this ability triggers again.\n\nQ: If I secure Farseers, does *Connected* trigger?\nA: No. Farseers being drawn as a result of Connected does not see the timing window to then trigger its ability to look at a Rival's hand and swap a card with them.",
		"4": "Anarchist",
		"5": "Shaper\n\nQ: Do resources \"you have\" apply to resources on a Cartel card?\nA: Yes, you can use resources from a Cartel card for Mythic.\n\nQ: Can I Catapult move from a gate that has a starport from Gate Ports?\nA: Yes. The ability just indicates that you cannot Catapult move by *using* the starport.",
		"6": "Agitator",
		"7": "Quartermaster\n\nQ: When does Resilient count the number of starports I control?\nA: Resilient checks the number of starports after battle. If the battle destroys a starport previously controlled by Quartermaster, or if the battle causes the Quartermaster to lose control over a starport, it does not add to the number of repairs."
