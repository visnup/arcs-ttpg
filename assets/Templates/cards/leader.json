		"1": "Mystic\n\nQ: If a resource stack is empty, can I still tax it to then gain a Psionic from *Attuned*?\nA: You can tax a city even if its resource stack is empty. You do not gain the first resource into your area.",
		"2": "Fuel-Drinker\n\nQ: If a resource stack is empty, can I still tax it to then gain a Fuel from *Insatiable*?\nA: You can tax a city even if its resource stack is empty. You do not gain the first resource into your area.",
		"3": "Upstart\n\nQ: If you are the Upstart, have Empath's Bond, and Empath is declared, can you tax a loyal city that you do not control?\nA: The \"any\" in Empath's Bond should be interpreted as \"non-Loyal,\" and Callow should be rephrased to “You cannot tax cities that you do not control.” As a result, Empath's Bond when active only gives the Upstart the ability to use Rival starports to build and Catapult move.",
		"4": "Rebel\n\nQ: Can I choose not to use the two extra dice from *Committed*?\nA: No, collecting these two dice is mandatory.\n\nQ: How does *Disorganized* interact with Predictive Sensors?\nA: Predictive Sensors is subject to this restriction. When the Rebel uses Predictive Sensors, they can move in up to 2 ships from each adjacent system. This is because a move is defined as “number of Loyal ships from one system to an adjacent system.”\n\nQ: How does Disorganized interact with Force Beams?\nA: Force Beams ignores this restriction.",
		"5": "Warrior\n\nQ: Do I have to move and battle with the same ships with *Tactical*?\nA: You can move and battle with different ships.\n\nQ: Can the *Tactical* move be a Catapult move?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can I do the *Tactical* move if I end up moving to a space with no ships to battle?\nA: You must perform a legal Battle action after moving (must have a legal target to attack). Otherwise the move must be undone.",
		"6": "Feastbringer\n\nQ: Do my Influence and Secure actions need to be on the same card?\nA: You can influence and secure different cards.\n\nQ: Do I have to secure after I influence?\nA: You must perform a legal secure after you influence. (You must have a legal target to secure.) Otherwise the influence must be undone.",
		"7": "Demagogue\n\nQ: How many cards can I influence with **Bold**?\nA: You may put up to one agent on each card in the Court."
