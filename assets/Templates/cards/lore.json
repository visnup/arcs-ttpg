	"CardNames": {
		"0": "Tool-Priests",
		"1": "Galactic Rifles\n\nQ: Is *Fire Rifles* modified by abilities that modify Battle?\nA: Abilities that modify Battle do not apply to *Fire Rifles*. For example, you cannot use Skirmishers to reroll the dice, and you cannot use Gatekeepers to collect more dice.",
		"2": "Sprinter Drives\n\nQ: Can Sprinter Drives activate more uses of Sprinter Drives?\nA: No, it is not recursive. The more verbose but correct text is: When you move fresh Loyal ships but not with Sprinter Drives, you may move any of them one more time.\n\nQ: Can the bonus move be a Catapult move?\nA: You can Catapult move with the bonus move.\n\nQ: If I catapult move and drop off ships in gates along my path, can each ship move again?\nA: Each fresh Loyal ship that moved can move one more time, independently and to a different destination.",
		"3": "Mirror Plating",
		"4": "Hidden Harbors",
		"5": "Signal Breaker\n\nQ: Can you limit which ships are battling?\nA: Attacker's Loyal ships in the battle system are all “attacking ships”. Therefore, all Loyal ships in the battle system must be fresh at the start of battle to use Signal Breaker.\n\nQ: Does Signal Break block the Intercept generated by Mirror Plating?\nA: Signal Breaker lets you “ignore one intercept you roll”. However, this cannot ignore the intercept added by Mirror Plating, because it is not rolled.\n\nQ: Does Signal Break take effect before Railgun Arrays?\nA: Signal Breaker checks if all the attacking ships are fresh at the beginning of the battle, before Railgun Arrays deals one hit.",
		"6": "Repair Drones",
		"7": "Gate Ports\n\nQ: What happens if this is transferred with Knowledge Set Free or scrapped from the Caretaker Act III Objective?\nA: Your starports in gates can still build ships and enable Catapult moves, but you can no longer take Captives with them.\n\nQ: If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have a starport in the same gate?\nA: No, it is a maximum of one total.",
		"8": "Cloud Cities\n\nQ: Can I spend a resource to build a city while outraged in that resource?\nA: Yes, Outrage does not stop you from spending the resource at all. It only stops you from spending it for its standard Prelude action.\n\nQ: Do I need to have the resource to build the city?\nA: Building a Cloud City requires spending a resource of the planet type.\n\nQ: If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have an extra city on the same planet?\nA: No, it is a maximum of one total.",
		"9": "Living Structures",
		"10": "Gate Stations\n\nQ: What happens if the cluster has no cities?\nA: If a Gate Station is in a cluster with no other city, it has no type. Destroying it provokes no Outrage. Taxing it yields no resource, but it can still be taxed.\n\nQ: What happens if this is transferred with Knowledge Set Free or scrapped from the Caretaker Act III Objective?\nA: If transferred, your cities in gates still operate in the same way. If scrapped, your cities in gates no longer have a type, so they no longer produce resources when taxed and no longer Provoke Outrage when destroyed.\n\nQ: If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have a city in the same gate?\nA: No, it is a maximum of one total.",
		"11": "Railgun Arrays",
		"12": "Ancient Holdings\n\nQ: Can Ancient Holdings hold Golems?\nA: Yes, Ancient Holdings provides a resource slot that holds one Golem.",
		"13": "Seeker Torpedoes\n\nQ: Can I reroll this multiple times?\nA: No, only once."
