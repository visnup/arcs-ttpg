Arcs Base Game with Leaders and Lore

Nothing scripted yet so you’ll have to do setup yourself.

Press "R" to toggle ship damage. There’s a card tray to place face up discard into if you wish. Playing an
extra card to seize the initiative can be finicky as TTP wants to stack the cards and would reveal your face
down card, so be careful when aiming for the snap point below the action card play area.
